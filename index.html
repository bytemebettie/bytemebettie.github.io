                        In 1999, while working as a Maid, I decided to start teaching myself 
                        how to code using a borrowed book, a borrowed computer, and on borrowed 
                        dial-up internet.  <br><br>
			    In 2001, I was offered my first programming job as a 
                        Logistics Analyst.  My first project, I was tasked with developing a database-driven 
                         Night Vision Goggles inventory system for a US Navy Vision Lab.  <br><br>
                        The rest, as they say, is history.<br><br>
			I have a big ol' chunk of a black bear hamster aptly named Lily Munchster.  You can follow her
